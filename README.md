# London Python Dojo Meetup 
### Feburary 5th 2025

This dojo group voted to allow the use of AI and gave participants a choice of two tasks:

## A. Langton's Ant

## B. Image to ASCII 

### Langton's Ant


**Langton's Ant** simulates and visualizes the behavior of Langton's Ant, a well-known algorithmic automaton that moves on a grid and follows simple rules to create intricate patterns.

This project allows exploration of how simple rules can lead to complex, emergent patterns.
  
Team 2 chose **Langton's Ant**

### Image to ASCII

This code inputs an image file and converts it into ASCII art while maintaining aspect ratio and providing a reasonable visual representation.

Team 6 chose **Image to ASCII**
