London Python Dojo Meetup 
Feburary 5th 2025


Group 6 task:
Create an ASCII image from a jpg or png input image. Use of LLMs is allowed.

We created two initial versions (branches GS-claude-version and MG-chatgpt-version), then compared the outputs from the initial prompts on ChatGPT and Claude.

Using a jupyter notebook, we discussed how to modify the prompts to improve the results after running each code snippet.

We then used chatgpt to create a README for the updated version of MG-chatgpt-version.
