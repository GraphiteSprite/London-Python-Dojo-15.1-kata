# Image to ASCII Art Converter

A Python program that converts PNG images into ASCII art, creating text-based representations that preserve the visual essence of the original image. This tool transforms images into ASCII characters, with different characters representing different levels of brightness.

## Features

- Converts PNG images to ASCII art
- Maintains aspect ratio during conversion
- Customizable output width
- Supports both console display and file saving
- Simple command-line interface
- No numpy dependency required

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

Install the required dependency using pip:
```bash
pip install Pillow
```

## Installation

1. Clone or download the script to your local machine
2. Ensure you have the prerequisites installed
3. Run the script using Python 3

## Usage

1. Run the script:
```bash
python ascii_art_converter-claude-version-1.py
```

2. Follow the prompts:
   - Enter the path to your PNG image
   - Specify desired output width (default is 100 characters)
   - Choose whether to save the output to a file

## How It Works

The converter uses the following process:

1. Image Processing:
   - Loads the input PNG image
   - Converts it to grayscale
   - Resizes while maintaining aspect ratio

2. ASCII Conversion:
   - Maps pixel brightness values (0-255) to ASCII characters
   - Uses a character set from darkest to lightest: @%#*+=-:. 
   - Generates ASCII art line by line

3. Output:
   - Displays the result in the console
   - Optionally saves to a text file

## Example Usage

```python
# Using as a module
from ascii_art_converter import image_to_ascii

ascii_art = image_to_ascii("path/to/your/image.png", output_width=100)
print(ascii_art)
```

## Limitations

- Works best with images that have good contrast
- Output quality depends on terminal/font settings
- Very small details might be lost in conversion
- Terminal line spacing affects the final appearance

## Customization

You can modify the ASCII character set in the `get_ascii_char` function to use different characters for the brightness levels. The current set (`@%#*+=-:. `) goes from darkest to lightest.

## Error Handling

The program includes error handling for:
- File opening issues
- Invalid image files
- File saving problems
