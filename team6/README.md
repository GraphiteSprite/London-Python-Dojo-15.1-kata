We created two initial versions (branches GS-claude-version and MG-chatgpt-version), then compared the outputs from the initial prompts on ChatGPT and Claude.

Using a jupyter notebook, we discussed how to modify the prompts to improve the results after running each code snippet.

We then used chatgpt to create a README for the updated version of MG-chatgpt-version.

The Jupyter notebook outlines various methods to convert an image into ASCII art using Python. The steps are as follows:

1. **Setup**: The notebook begins by introducing the concept and provides a brief overview of how to create ASCII art from images using Python.
   
2. **Basic Code for Conversion**: The notebook uses the `PIL` library (Python Imaging Library) to manipulate images. It includes functions to:
   - Resize images to fit the desired output.
   - Convert images to grayscale.
   - Map pixel values to corresponding ASCII characters based on grayscale intensity.
   
3. **Conversion Functions**: The core functionality is encapsulated in functions like `image_to_ascii()` that convert an image to ASCII and then save or display it. It includes error handling for issues when opening the image.

4. **Adjusting the Code for Jupyter Notebook**: The code was adjusted to properly display ASCII art in a Jupyter notebook environment using `display()`.

5. **Refinements**: The notebook explores adjustments to improve the visual quality of the ASCII output by fine-tuning how characters are mapped to pixel values, ensuring better representation of the image in ASCII.

6. **Final Output**: Users can specify the path to an image, along with width and height parameters, and view the generated ASCII art in a Jupyter notebook.

In summary, this notebook serves as a tutorial on how to convert images to ASCII art in Python, with particular focus on using it in a Jupyter notebook and ensuring the output is visually appropriate.
